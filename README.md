# VR Shooting Range
### Author: Peter Swanson

## Background
When I first got my HTC VIVE virtual reality headset, I wanted to learn how the basics of developing VR games. 

<b>This is a virtual reality shooting range I built using the Unity game engine.</b>

## Functionality
### Running the game:
Run <i>VR Shooting Range.exe</i> with SteamVR running and an HTC VIVE headset connected.

## Files
 - Scripts/ - Contains the scripts I wrote for this project
 - Src/ - Contains the Unity source code for the game
 - VR Shooting Range.exe - The game executable

## Note
This build is heavily compressed to meet Github's file size standards. As a result, meshes and textures look lower than actual quality.
